# Churned Bank Customers Analysis
This project is an exploratory and a predictive analysis on churned bank customers to find out any possible patterns between customer behaviour and their (possible) reason to stop using this bank's services.

> Business question: How can this bank decrease, or better yet, prevent the churn rate?
