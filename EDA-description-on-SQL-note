The data set contains 10,000 customers across 3 countries: France, Germany and Spain. By the number of customers, France has the largest customer base, then Germany, then Spain. 
However by the number of churned customers, Germany has the highest churning rate, then France, then Spain. This indicates that Germany needs some extra analysis in either internal factor (i.e platform infrastructure issues, customer service, etc.) and external factor.
By gender, there are more male than female customers, although the ratio is nearly equally distributed between the two (the male to female ratio is 55/45).
By age group, the working age (25-54) is the main group of customer (80%), then mature working age (6%), then young adult (4%), then elderly (2%)., which makes sense as the working age group has the most purchase power with stable finance, therefore explains their need for banking service and products to facilitate their financial usage.
The churn rate is 20.37% = 2037/10,000 customers have exited this bank's service.
3617/10,000 customers have zero in their balance. This indicates some possible customer behaviour such as financial hardships, recent transactions, automated payments, financial planning, bank fees.
Only 500 out of 3617 accounts with zero are actually inactive. 
7055/10,000 customers are using the credit card service. 5151/10,000 customers are still active. 3607/7055 customers (36%) using credit card service that are still active.
